1004	You just call your broker and say `` buy '' or `` sell . ''	PRP RB VBP PRP$ NN CC VBP `` VB '' CC `` VB . ''
1005	Dream on .	NNP NNP .
1006	There are all sorts of ways to give buy and sell instructions to a broker -- and just as many ways to get burned if you do n't know what you 're doing .	EX VBP DT NNS IN NNS TO VB NN CC VB NNS TO DT NN : CC RB IN JJ NNS TO VB VBN IN PRP VBP RB VB WP PRP VBP VBG .
1007	So here 's a rundown of the most common types of market orders permitted by the stock and commodity exchanges .	RB RB VBZ DT NN IN DT RBS JJ NNS IN NN NNS VBN IN DT NN CC NN NNS .
1008	Two things to keep in mind : Not all exchanges accept every type of order .	CD NNS TO VB IN NN : RB DT NNS VBP DT NN IN NN .
1009	And even when a specific order is acceptable to an exchange , a brokerage firm can refuse to enter it for a customer .	CC RB WRB DT JJ NN VBZ JJ TO DT NN , DT NN NN MD VB TO VB PRP IN DT NN .
1010	Market Order : This is probably the most widely used order -- and the one most open to abuse by unscrupulous floor brokers , since it imposes no price restrictions .	NNP NNP : DT VBZ RB DT RBS RB VBN NN : CC DT CD RBS JJ TO VB IN JJ NN NNS , IN PRP VBZ DT NN NNS .
1011	With a market order , an investor tells a broker to buy or sell `` at the market . ''	IN DT NN NN , DT NN VBZ DT NN TO VB CC VB `` IN DT NN . ''
1012	It 's like saying , `` get me in now '' or `` get me out now . ''	PRP VBZ IN VBG , `` VB PRP IN RB '' CC `` VB PRP IN RB . ''
1013	For example , if wheat is being offered at $ 4.065 and bid at $ 4.060 , a market order to buy would be filled at the higher price and a market order to sell at the lower price .	IN NN , IN NN VBZ VBG VBN IN $ CD CC NN IN $ CD , DT NN NN TO VB MD VB VBN IN DT JJR NN CC DT NN NN TO VB IN DT JJR NN .
1014	A recent indictment alleges that some floor brokers at the two largest Chicago commodity exchanges used market orders to fill customers ' orders at unfavorable prices by arranging trades with fellow brokers .

1015	Profits realized from these trades would then be shared by the conspiring brokers .	NNS VBD IN DT NNS MD RB VB VBN IN DT VBG NNS .
1016	Limit Order : Limit orders are used when investors want to restrict the amount they will receive or pay for an investment .	VB NNP : VB NNS VBP VBN WRB NNS VBP TO VB DT NN PRP MD VB CC VB IN DT NN .
1017	Investors do this by specifying a minimum price at which the investment may be sold or the maximum price that may be paid for it .	NNS VBP DT IN VBG DT JJ NN IN WDT DT NN MD VB VBN CC DT JJ NN WDT MD VB VBN IN PRP .
1018	Suppose an investor wants to sell a stock , but not for less than $ 55 .	VB DT NN VBZ TO VB DT NN , CC RB IN JJR IN $ NN .
1019	A limit order to sell could be entered at that price .	DT NN NN TO VB MD VB VBN IN DT NN .
1020	One risk : Investors may regret the restriction if the stock reaches 54 and then falls .	CD NN : NNS MD VB DT NN IN DT NN VBZ CD CC RB VBZ .
1021	Unless the market goes at least one tick -LRB- the smallest price increment permitted -RRB- beyond the limit price , investors are n't assured of having their orders filled because there may not be sufficient trading volume to permit filling it at the specified price .	IN DT NN VBZ IN JJS CD VB ( DT JJS NN NN VBN ) IN DT NN NN , NNS VBP RB VBN IN VBG PRP$ NNS VBN IN EX MD RB VB JJ NN NN TO VB VBG PRP IN DT VBN NN .
1022	Stop Order : Stop orders tell a floor broker to buy or sell an investment once the price reaches a certain level .	VB NNP : VB NNS VB DT NN NN TO VB CC VB DT NN RB DT NN VBZ DT JJ NN .
1023	Once the price reaches that level , a stop order turns into a market order , and the order is filled at whatever price the broker can get .	RB DT NN VBZ DT NN , DT NN NN VBZ IN DT NN NN , CC DT NN VBZ VBN IN WDT VBP DT NN MD VB .
1024	Stop orders are sometimes called `` stop-loss '' orders because they are frequently used to protect profits or limit losses .	VB NNS VBP RB VBN `` NN '' NNS IN PRP VBP RB VBN TO VB NNS CC NN NNS .
1025	While stop orders sound similar to limit orders , there is a difference : Sell stops must be entered at a price below the current market price and buy stops above .	IN NN NNS VBP JJ TO VB NNS , EX VBZ DT NN : VB VBZ MD VB VBN IN DT NN IN DT JJ NN NN CC VB VBZ RB .
1026	In contrast , sell limit orders must be placed above the market price and buy limit orders are placed below .	IN NN , VB NN NNS MD VB VBN IN DT NN NN CC VB NN NNS VBP VBN RB .

1028	An investor who may have placed a stop-loss order at $ 90 under a stock that was trading at $ 100 a share on the Friday before the crash was stunned to discover that the order was filled at $ 75 when the stock opened at that price on Monday .

1029	Stop-Limit Order : Stop-limit orders turn into limit orders when an investment trades at the price specified in the order .	NNP NNP : JJ NNS VBP IN NN NNS WRB DT NN NNS IN DT NN VBN IN DT NN .
1030	Unlike stop orders -- which are filled at the market price when the stop price is hit -- stop-limit orders demand that the trades be made only at the specified price .	IN NN NNS : WDT VBP VBN IN DT NN NN WRB DT NN NN VBZ VBN : JJ NNS VBP IN DT NNS VBP VBN RB IN DT VBN NN .
1031	If it ca n't be made at that price , it does n't get filled .	IN PRP MD RB VB VBN IN DT NN , PRP VBZ RB VB VBN .
1032	Investors who wish to be out of a position , without the risk of receiving a worse-than-expected price from a market order , may use this type of order to specify the price at which the order must be filled .	NNS WP VBP TO VB IN IN DT NN , IN DT NN IN VBG DT JJ NN IN DT NN NN , MD VB DT NN IN NN TO VB DT NN IN WDT DT NN MD VB VBN .
1033	But if the market moves quickly enough , it may be impossible for the broker to carry out the order because the investment has passed the specified price .	CC IN DT NN NNS RB RB , PRP MD VB JJ IN DT NN TO VB RP IN NN IN DT NN VBZ VBN DT VBN NN .
1034	Market-If-Touched Order : Market-if-touched orders are like stop orders in that they become market orders if a specified price is reached .	NNP NNP : JJ NNS VBP IN NN NNS IN DT PRP VBP NN NNS IN DT VBN NN VBZ VBN .
1035	However , unlike a buy-stop order , a buy market-if-touched order is entered at a price below the current price , while a sell market-if-touched order is entered at a price above it .	RB , IN DT JJ NN , DT NN NN NN VBZ VBN IN DT NN IN DT JJ NN , IN DT NN NN NN VBZ VBN IN DT NN IN PRP .
1036	As soon as the market trades at the specified price the floor broker will fill it at the best possible price .	RB RB IN DT NN NNS IN DT VBN NN DT NN NN MD VB PRP IN DT JJS JJ NN .
1037	Fill-Or-Kill Order : The fill-or-kill order is one of several associated with the timing of trades .	NNP NNP : DT JJ NN VBZ CD IN RB VBN IN DT NN IN NNS .
1038	It instructs a broker to buy or sell an investment at the specified price or better .	PRP VBZ DT NN TO VB CC VB DT NN IN DT VBN NN CC JJR .
1039	But if the investment ca n't be bought or sold immediately , the order is automatically canceled .	CC IN DT NN MD RB VB VBN CC VBN RB , DT NN VBZ RB VBN .

1043	Not-Held Order : This is another timing order .	NNP NNP : DT VBZ DT NN NN .
1044	It is a market order that allows floor brokers to take more time to buy or sell an investment , if they think they can get a better price by waiting .	PRP VBZ DT NN NN WDT VBZ NN NNS TO VB JJR NN TO VB CC VB DT NN , IN PRP VBP PRP MD VB DT JJR NN IN VBG .
1045	Not-held orders , which are also known as `` disregard the tape '' orders , are always done at the customer 's risk .	JJ NNS , WDT VBP RB VBN IN `` NN DT NN '' NNS , VBP RB VBN IN DT NN POS NN .
1046	One-Cancels-The-Other Order : This is really two orders in one , generally for the same security or commodity , instructing floor brokers to fill whichever order they can first and then cancel the other order .	NNP NNP : DT VBZ RB CD NNS IN CD , RB IN DT JJ NN CC NN , VBG NN NNS TO VB WDT VBP PRP MD RB CC RB VB DT JJ NN .

1059	IN SIZING UP the risks of stock-market investments , there 's probably no starting place better than `` beta . ''	IN NNP IN DT NNS IN NN NNS , EX VBZ RB DT VBG NN JJR IN `` NN . ''
1060	But investors better not ignore its limitations , either .	CC NNS RBR RB VB PRP$ NNS , RB .
1061	Beta is a handy gauge that measures the volatility of a stock or stock mutual fund .	NNP VBZ DT JJ NN IN VBZ DT NN IN DT NN CC NN JJ NN .
1062	For any given move in the overall market , it suggests how steeply that particular issue might rise or fall .	IN DT VBN NN IN DT JJ NN , PRP VBZ WRB RB IN JJ NN MD VB CC NN .
1063	Beta figures are widely available and easy to interpret .	JJ NNS VBP RB JJ CC JJ TO VB .
1064	The beta of the broad market , typically defined as the Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index , is always 1.0 .	DT NN IN DT JJ NN , RB VBN IN DT NNP CC NNP POS JJ NN , VBZ RB CD .
1065	So a stock with a beta of 0.5 is half as volatile , one at 1.5 is 50 % more volatile , and so on .	RB DT NN IN DT NN IN CD VBZ NN IN JJ , CD IN CD VBZ CD NN RBR JJ , CC RB RB .
1066	Cautious investors should generally go with stocks that have low betas .	JJ NNS MD RB VB IN NNS WDT VBP JJ NNS .
1067	Go with high-beta stocks to get the biggest payoff from a bet on a bull market .	VB IN JJ NNS TO VB DT JJS NN IN DT NN IN DT NN NN .
1068	Remember , though , that beta also has important limitations .	VB , RB , DT NN RB VBZ JJ NNS .
1069	`` Beta is only part of the risk in a stock , '' says William F. Sharpe , the Stanford University emeritus professor who developed the measure .	`` NNP VBZ JJ NN IN DT NN IN DT NN , '' VBZ NNP NNP NNP , DT NNP NNP NN NN WP VBD DT NN .

1071	In particular , beta does n't measure the company - and industry-specific risk associated with an individual stock .	IN JJ , NN VBZ RB VB DT NN : CC JJ NN VBN IN DT JJ NN .
1072	That `` business '' risk is very significant for an investor with only a few stocks , but it virtually disappears in a large and well-diversified portfolio .	DT `` NN '' NN VBZ RB JJ IN DT NN IN RB DT JJ NNS , CC PRP RB VBZ IN DT JJ CC JJ NN .
1073	Beta is also a poor indicator of the risk in stock groups that march to their own drummer .	NNP VBZ RB DT JJ NN IN DT NN IN NN NNS WDT VBP TO PRP$ JJ NN .
1074	In particular , the prices of gold and other precious-metals stocks shoot up and down , but the stocks tend to have low betas because their moves are not market-inspired .	IN JJ , DT NNS IN NN CC JJ NNS NNS VBP IN CC RB , CC DT NNS VBP TO VB JJ NNS IN PRP$ NNS VBP RB JJ .

1594	Besides term life and whole life -LRB- the old standbys -RRB- , we now have universal life , universal variable life , flexible adjustable universal life , policies with persistency bonuses , policies festooned with exotic riders , living benefit policies , and on and on .

1595	What to do ?	WP TO VB .
1596	First , generalize .	RB , VB .
1597	Shorn of all their riders , special provisions , and other bells and whistles , insurance policies can still be grouped under two broad categories : so-called pure insurance , which amasses no cash value in the policy and pays off only upon death , and permanent insurance , which provides not only a death benefit but also a cash value in the policy that can be used in various ways while the insured is still alive .	VBN IN DT PRP$ NNS , JJ NNS , CC JJ NNS CC NNS , NN NNS MD RB VB VBN IN CD JJ NNS : JJ JJ NN , WDT VBZ DT NN NN IN DT NN CC VBZ IN RB IN NN , CC JJ NN , WDT VBZ RB RB DT NN NN CC RB DT NN NN IN DT NN WDT MD VB VBN IN JJ NNS IN DT VBN VBZ RB JJ .
1598	If all you want is death-benefit coverage , pure insurance -- a term policy -- gives you maximum bang for your buck , within limits .	IN DT PRP VBP VBZ JJ NN , JJ NN : DT NN NN : VBZ PRP JJ NN IN PRP$ NN , IN NNS .
1599	It 's much cheaper than permanent insurance bought at the same age .	PRP VBZ RB JJR IN JJ NN VBD IN DT JJ NN .
1600	But `` term '' means just that ; the policy is written for a specific time period only and must be renewed when it expires .	CC `` NN '' VBZ RB IN : DT NN VBZ VBN IN DT JJ NN NN RB CC MD VB VBN WRB PRP VBZ .
1601	It may also stipulate that the insured must pass another medical exam before renewal ; if you flunk -- which means you need insurance more than ever -- you may not be able to buy it .	PRP MD RB VB IN DT VBN MD VB DT JJ NN IN NN : IN PRP VBP : WDT VBZ PRP VBP NN JJR IN RB : PRP MD RB VB JJ TO VB PRP .
1602	Even if you 're healthy and can renew , your premium will go up sharply because you 're that much older .	RB IN PRP VBP JJ CC MD VB , PRP$ NN MD VB IN RB IN PRP VBP IN RB JJR .
1603	So term insurance may not be as cheap as it looks .	RB VBP NN MD RB VB RB JJ IN PRP VBZ .
1604	There are all sorts of variations on term insurance : policies structured to pay off your mortgage debt , term riders tacked on to permanent insurance , and many others .	EX VBP DT NNS IN NNS IN NN NN : NNS VBN TO VB IN PRP$ NN NN , NN NNS VBD IN TO JJ NN , CC JJ NNS .
1605	One variation that appealed to me at first was the `` Money Smart Term Life '' policy offered by Amex Life Insurance Co. , the American Express unit , to the parent company 's credit-card holders .	CD NN WDT VBD TO PRP IN JJ VBD DT `` NNP NNP NNP NNP '' NN VBN IN NNP NNP NNP NNP , DT NNP NNP NN , TO DT NN NN POS NN NNS .
1606	Upon examination , however , I wondered whether the plan made a lot of sense .	IN NN , RB , PRP VBD IN DT NN VBD DT NN IN NN .
1607	Amex said it would charge me $ 576 a year for $ 100,000 of coverage -- and would pay me back all the premiums I put in if I canceled the policy after 10 years .	NNP VBD PRP MD VB PRP $ CD DT NN IN $ CD IN NN : CC MD VB PRP RB PDT DT NNS PRP VBP IN IN PRP VBD DT NN IN CD NNS .
1608	Sounds great -- or does it ?	VBZ JJ : CC VBZ PRP .
1609	First , if I canceled , I 'd have no more insurance , a not insignificant consideration .	RB , IN PRP VBD , PRP MD VB DT JJR NN , DT RB JJ NN .
1610	Second , the $ 5,760 I 'd get back would be much diminished in purchasing power by 10 years of inflation ; Amex , not I , would get the benefit of the investment income on my money , income that would have exceeded the inflation rate and thus given the company a real profit .	JJ , DT $ CD PRP MD VB RB MD VB RB VBN IN VBG NN IN CD NNS IN NN : NNP , RB PRP , MD VB DT NN IN DT NN NN IN PRP$ NN , NN WDT MD VB VBN DT NN NN CC RB VBN DT NN DT JJ NN .
1611	Third and most important , Amex would charge me a far higher premium than other reputable companies would on a straight term policy for the same amount ; I 'd be paying so heavily just to have the option of getting my premiums back that I 'd almost have to cancel to make the whole thing worthwhile .	NNP CC RBS JJ , NNP MD VB PRP DT RB JJR NN IN JJ JJ NNS MD IN DT JJ NN NN IN DT JJ NN : PRP MD VB VBG RB RB RB TO VB DT NN IN VBG PRP$ NNS RB IN PRP MD RB VB TO VB TO VB DT JJ NN JJ .
1612	That would be all right with Amex , which could then lock in its investment profit , but it does n't add up to a `` smart money '' move for me .	DT MD VB DT NN IN NNP , WDT MD RB VB IN PRP$ NN NN , CC PRP VBZ RB VB IN TO DT `` JJ NN '' NN IN PRP .
1613	Which goes to show that the First Law applies in insurance as in anything else : There is no free lunch , there is only marketing .	WDT VBZ TO VB IN DT NNP NNP VBZ IN NN IN IN NN RB : EX VBZ DT JJ NN , EX VBZ JJ NN .
1614	And the Second Law , unique to insurance ?	CC DT NNP NNP , JJ TO NN .
1615	If I die early , I win -- a hollow victory , since I ca n't enjoy it -- and if I live long , the insurer wins .	IN PRP VBP JJ , PRP VBP : DT JJ NN , IN PRP MD RB VB PRP : CC IN PRP VBP JJ , DT NN NNS .
1616	Always .	RB .
1617	This is worth remembering when insurers and their salesmen try to sell you permanent insurance , the kind that amasses cash value .	DT VBZ JJ NN WRB NNS CC PRP$ NNS VBP TO VB PRP JJ NN , DT NN WDT VBZ NN NN .
1618	The word `` death '' can not be escaped entirely by the industry , but salesmen dodge it wherever possible or cloak it in euphemisms , preferring to talk about `` savings '' and `` investment '' instead .	DT NN `` NN '' MD RB VB VBN RB IN DT NN , CC NNS VBP PRP WRB JJ CC NN PRP IN NNS , VBG TO VB IN `` NNS '' CC `` NN '' RB .
1619	The implication is that your permanent-insurance policy is really some kind of CD or mutual-fund account with an added feature .	DT NN VBZ IN PRP$ JJ NN VBZ RB DT NN IN NNP CC JJ NN IN DT VBN NN .
1620	That is gilding the lily .	DT VBZ NN DT NN .
1621	The fact is that as a savings or investment vehicle , insurance generally runs a poor second to any direct investment you might make in the same things the insurance company is putting your money into .	DT NN VBZ IN IN DT NNS CC NN NN , NN RB VBZ DT JJ JJ TO DT JJ NN PRP MD VB IN DT JJ NNS DT NN NN VBZ VBG PRP$ NN IN .
1622	That 's because you have to pay for the insurance portion of the policy and the effort required to sell and service the whole package .	DT VBZ IN PRP VBP TO VB IN DT NN NN IN DT NN CC DT NN VBN TO VB CC VB DT JJ NN .
1623	Again , no free lunch .	RB , DT JJ NN .
1624	This is reflected in a built-in mortality cost -- in effect , your share of the company 's estimated liability in paying off beneficiaries of people who had the effrontery to die while under its protection .	DT VBZ VBN IN DT JJ NN NN : IN NN , PRP$ NN IN DT NN POS VBN NN IN VBG IN NNS IN NNS WP VBD DT NN TO VB IN IN PRP$ NN .
1625	And in most cases , a huge hunk of your premium in the initial year or two of the the policy is , in effect , paying the salesman 's commission as well ; investment returns on most policies are actually negative for several years , largely because of this .	CC IN RBS NNS , DT JJ NN IN PRP$ NN IN DT JJ NN CC CD IN DT DT NN VBZ , IN NN , VBG DT NN POS NN IN RB : NN NNS IN RBS NNS VBP RB JJ IN JJ NNS , RB IN IN DT .
1626	So view permanent insurance for what it is -- a compromise between pure insurance and direct investment .	RB VBP JJ NN IN WP PRP VBZ : DT NN IN JJ NN CC JJ NN .
1627	The simplest , most traditional form of permanent insurance is the straight whole life policy .	DT JJS , RBS JJ NN IN JJ NN VBZ DT JJ JJ NN NN .
1628	You pay a set premium for a set amount of coverage , the company invests that premium in a portfolio of its choosing , and your cash value and dividends grow over the years .	PRP VBP DT VBN NN IN DT VBN NN IN NN , DT NN VBZ DT NN IN DT NN IN PRP$ NN , CC PRP$ NN NN CC NNS VBP IN DT NNS .
1629	One newer wrinkle , so called single-premium life -LRB- you pay for the whole policy at once -RRB- , has been immensely popular in recent years for tax reasons ; the insured could extract cash value in the form of policy `` loans , '' and none of the proceeds were taxable even though they included gains on investment .

1630	Congress closed this loophole last year , or thought it did .	NNP VBD DT NN JJ NN , CC VBD PRP VBD .
1631	However , Monarch Capital Corp. of Springfield , Mass. , has developed a `` combination plan '' of annuity and insurance coverage that it says does not violate the new regulations and that allows policy loans without tax consequences .

1632	But the percentage of your cash reserve that you can borrow tax-free is very small .	CC DT NN IN PRP$ NN NN IN PRP MD VB JJ VBZ RB JJ .
1633	I 'm not prepared in any case to put that much money into a policy immediately , so I look into the broad category called universal life .	PRP VBP RB VBN IN DT NN TO VB IN JJ NN IN DT NN RB , IN PRP VBP IN DT JJ NN VBD JJ NN .
1634	Hugely popular , it is far more flexible than straight whole life .	RB JJ , PRP VBZ RB RBR JJ IN JJ JJ NN .
1635	I can adjust the amount of insurance I want against the amount going into investment ; I can pay more or less than the so-called target premium in a given year ; and I can even skip payments if my cash reserves are enough to cover the insurance portion of the policy .

1636	In looking at these and other policies , I learn to ask pointed questions about some of the assumptions built into `` policy illustrations '' -- the rows of numbers that show me the buildup of my cash values over the years .	IN VBG IN DT CC JJ NNS , PRP VBP TO VB VBD NNS IN DT IN DT NNS VBN IN `` NN NNS '' : DT NNS IN VBZ DT NN PRP DT NN IN PRP$ NN NNS IN DT NNS .
1637	They commonly give two scenarios : One is based on interest rates that the company guarantees -LRB- usually 4 % to 4.5 % -RRB- and the other on the rate it is currently getting on investment , often 8.5 % or more .	PRP RB VBP CD NNS : CD VBZ VBN IN NN NNS IN DT NN NNS ( RB CD NN TO CD NN ) CC DT NN IN DT NN PRP VBZ RB VBG IN NN , RB CD NN CC JJR .
1638	Projecting the latter over several decades , I find my cash buildup is impressive -- but can any high interest rate prevail for that long ?	VBG DT NN IN JJ NNS , PRP VBP PRP$ NN NN VBZ JJ : CC MD DT JJ NN NN VB IN DT JJ .
1639	Not likely , I think .	RB JJ , PRP VBP .

1644	There are seemingly endless twists to universal life , and it pays to ask questions about all of them .	EX VBP RB JJ NNS TO JJ NN , CC PRP VBZ TO VB NNS IN DT IN PRP .
1645	At a back-yard barbecue , for example , a friend boasts that she 'll only have to pay premiums on her John Hancock policy for seven years and that her death benefits will then be `` guaranteed .

1649	I do n't like the sound of that .	PRP VBP RB IN DT NN IN DT .

1655	Some provisions would let me collect a percentage of the policy 's face value to pay for long-term care such as nursing-home stays ; others would allow payments for catastrophic illnesses and conditions such as cancer , heart attarcks , renal failure and kidney transplants .

3382	Another concern is liquidity , or how easily a security can be converted into cash .	DT NN VBZ NN , CC WRB RB DT NN MD VB VBN IN NN .
3383	The secondary , or resale , market for asset-backed securities is relatively new and much less active than for Treasury issues .	DT JJ , CC NN , NN IN JJ NNS VBZ RB JJ CC RB RBR JJ IN IN NNP NNS .

3389	Evaluating asset-backed securities poses another problem .	VBG JJ NNS VBZ DT NN .

3394	The prospectus also notes that the securities are not guaranteed by any government agency .	DT NN RB VBZ IN DT NNS VBP RB VBN IN DT NN NN .

3404	If a bank 's credit rating was lowered because of , say , its loans to Third World nations , that could also affect the ratings , liquidity and prices of the asset-backed issues that the bank supports .

4750	First , why ticket splitting has increased and taken the peculiar pattern that it has over the past half century : Prior to the election of Franklin Roosevelt as president and the advent of the New Deal , government occupied a much smaller role in society and the prisoner 's dilemma problem confronting voters in races for Congress was considerably less severe .	RB , WRB NN NN VBZ VBN CC VBN DT JJ NN IN PRP VBZ IN DT JJ NN NN : RB TO DT NN IN NNP NNP IN NN CC DT NN IN DT NNP NNP , NN VBD DT RB JJR NN IN NN CC DT NN POS NN NN VBG NNS IN NNS IN NNP VBD RB RBR JJ .
4751	Second , it explains why voters hold Congress in disdain but generally love their own congressional representatives : Any individual legislator 's constituents appreciate the specific benefits that the legislator wins for them but not the overall cost associated with every other legislator doing likewise for his own constituency .	JJ , PRP VBZ WRB NNS VBP NNP IN NN CC RB VBP PRP$ JJ JJ NNS : DT JJ NN POS NNS VBP DT JJ NNS IN DT NN VBZ IN PRP CC RB DT JJ NN VBN IN DT JJ NN VBG RB IN PRP$ JJ NN .
4752	Third , the theory suggests why legislators who pay too much attention to national policy making relative to local benefit-seeking have lower security in office .	NNP , DT NN VBZ WRB NNS WP VBP RB JJ NN TO JJ NN VBG JJ TO JJ NN VBP JJR NN IN NN .
4753	For example , first-term members of the House , once the most vulnerable of incumbents , have become virtually immune to defeat .	IN NN , JJ NNS IN DT NNP , RB DT RBS JJ IN NNS , VBP VBN RB JJ TO VB .
4754	The one exception to this recent trend was the defeat of 13 of the 52 freshman Republicans brought into office in 1980 by the Reagan revolution and running for re-election in 1982 .	DT CD NN TO DT JJ NN VBD DT NN IN CD IN DT CD NN NNPS VBN IN NN IN CD IN DT NNP NN CC VBG IN NN IN CD .
4755	Because these freshmen placed far more emphasis on their partisan role -- spreading the Reagan revolution -- in national policy making , they were more vulnerable to defeat .	IN DT NNS VBN RB JJR NN IN PRP$ JJ NN : VBG DT NNP NN : IN JJ NN VBG , PRP VBD RBR JJ TO VB .
4756	Fourth , the theory indicates why the Republican Party may have a difficult time attracting viable candidates for congressional office .	NNP , DT NN VBZ WRB DT NNP NNP MD VB DT JJ NN VBG JJ NNS IN JJ NN .
4757	Potential candidates may be discouraged from running less by the congressional salary than by the prospect of defeat at the hands of a Democratic opponent .	JJ NNS MD VB VBN IN VBG JJR IN DT JJ NN IN IN DT NN IN NN IN DT NNS IN DT JJ NN .
4758	To the extent that potential Republican candidates and their financial backers realize that the congressional prisoner 's dilemma game works to their disadvantage , the Republican Party will be hindered in its attempts to field a competitive slate of congressional candidates .

4759	Fifth , the theory may provide at least a partial reason for why ticket splitting has been particularly pronounced in the South .	NNP , DT NN MD VB IN JJS DT JJ NN IN WRB NN NN VBZ VBN RB VBN IN DT NNP .
4760	To the extent that Democratic legislators from the South have held a disproportionate share of power in Congress since 1932 and have been able to translate such clout into relatively more local benefits for their respective constituencies , voters in the South have had an especially strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office .

4761	Finally , the theory suggests why Republicans generally have fared better in Senate races than in campaigns for the House .	RB , DT NN VBZ WRB NNPS RB VBP VBN JJR IN NNP NNS IN IN NNS IN DT NNP .
4762	Since local benefit-seeking matters more and national policy making matters less in the lower chamber of Congress , this is precisely the pattern one would expect if Republicans are less willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than their Democratic counterparts .	IN JJ NN NNS JJR CC JJ NN VBG NNS JJR IN DT JJR NN IN NNP , DT VBZ RB DT NN PRP MD VB IN NNPS VBP RBR JJ TO VB IN JJ NN IN PRP$ JJ NNS .
4763	Is there any empirical support for this theory ?	VBZ EX DT JJ NN IN DT NN .
4764	Three pieces of evidence corroborate the key assumption that Democratic legislators are more willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than their Republican colleagues .	CD NNS IN NN VB DT JJ NN IN JJ NNS VBP RBR JJ TO VB IN JJ NN IN PRP$ NNP NNS .
4765	First , economists James Bennett and Thomas DiLorenzo find that GOP senators turn back roughly 10 % more of their allocated personal staff budgets than Democrats do .	RB , NNS NNP NNP CC NNP NNP VB IN NNP NNS VBP RB RB CD NN JJR IN PRP$ VBN JJ NN NNS IN NNPS VBP .
4766	To the extent that the primary duty of personal staff involves local benefit-seeking , this indicates that political philosophy leads congressional Republicans to pay less attention to narrow constituent concerns .	TO DT NN IN DT JJ NN IN JJ NN VBZ JJ NN , DT VBZ IN JJ NN VBZ JJ NNPS TO VB JJR NN TO VB NN NNS .
4767	Second , if the key assumption is valid , Democrats should have lower attendance rates on roll-call votes than Republicans do to the extent that such votes reflect national policy making and that participating in such votes takes away from the time a legislator could otherwise devote to local benefit-seeking .	JJ , IN DT JJ NN VBZ JJ , NNPS MD VB JJR NN NNS IN JJ NNS IN NNPS VBP TO DT NN IN JJ NNS VBP JJ NN VBG CC IN VBG IN JJ NNS VBZ RB IN DT NN DT NN MD RB VB TO JJ NN .
4768	This is indeed what the data indicate , particularly in the case of the House .	DT VBZ RB WP DT NNS VBP , RB IN DT NN IN DT NNP .
4769	The Democratic House attendance rate has not exceeded the Republican House attendance rate since 1959 .	DT NNP NNP NN NN VBZ RB VBN DT NNP NNP NN NN IN CD .
4770	Finally , as shown in the table , Democrats allocate a higher proportion of their personal staffs to district offices -- where local benefit-seeking duties matter more and national policy making activities matter less relative to Washington offices .	RB , IN VBN IN DT NN , NNPS VBP DT JJR NN IN PRP$ JJ NNS TO NN NNS : WRB JJ NN NNS VBP JJR CC JJ NN VBG NNS VBP RBR JJ TO NNP NNS .
4771	An examination of changes in personal staffing decisions in the Senate between 1986 and 1987 -LRB- when control of that body changed party hands -RRB- , moreover , reveals that the personal staffing differences noted in the table can not be attributed to the disproportionate control Democrats exercise , due to their majority-party status , over other resources such as committee staff .

4772	An additional piece of evidence from the Senate : Holding other factors constant , such as incumbency advantages and regional factors , the difference between popular votes for Republican presidential and senatorial candidates in states conducting a Senate election turns out to be a positive function of how onerous the federal government 's tax burden is per state -LRB- a progressive tax rate hits higher-income states harder -RRB- .

4773	Put more simply , GOP candidates for president are looked on more kindly by voters than Republican candidates for the Senate when the prisoner 's dilemma is more severe .	VB RBR RB , NNP NNS IN NN VBP VBN IN RBR RB IN NNS IN NNP NNS IN DT NNP WRB DT NN POS NN VBZ RBR JJ .

4776	A cross-state econometric investigation , furthermore , reveals that , holding other factors constant , the difference between a state 's major-party vote going to the Republican gubernatorial candidate and the Republican share of the lower state house is a positive function of the state tax rate .

6564	Thus we have a condition that is easily described as undemocratic .	RB PRP VBP DT NN WDT VBZ RB VBN IN JJ .

6567	So the Federal Reserve is an attractive target for complaint by politicians .	RB DT NNP NNP VBZ DT JJ NN IN NN IN NNS .
6568	The Fed is easily assigned the blame for unpleasantness , like high interest rates or slow economic growth , while the politicians can escape responsibility by pointing to the Fed 's independence .	DT NNP VBZ RB VBN DT NN IN NN , IN JJ NN NNS CC JJ JJ NN , IN DT NNS MD VB NN IN VBG TO DT NNP POS NN .
6569	This leads to proposals for `` reform '' of the Fed , which have the common feature of making the Fed more responsive to the administration , to the Congress and to public opinion -- without , however , any assumption of additional responsibility by the politicians .	DT VBZ TO NNS IN `` NN '' IN DT NNP , WDT VBP DT JJ NN IN VBG DT NNP RBR JJ TO DT NN , TO DT NNP CC TO JJ NN : IN , RB , DT NN IN JJ NN IN DT NNS .
6570	These proposals include changing the term of the chairman , shortening the terms of the members , eliminating the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks from the decision-making process , putting the Secretary of the Treasury on the Federal Reserve Board , having the Fed audited by an arm of Congress -LRB- the General Accounting Office -RRB- , putting the Fed 's expenditures in the budget , and requiring prompt publication of the Fed 's minutes .

6581	The enormous inflation over the past 30 years was largely due to monetary policy .	DT JJ NN IN DT JJ CD NNS VBD RB JJ TO JJ NN .

6584	The basic problem of monetary policy , to which reform of the Fed should be addressed , is to prevent a recurrence of this experience .	DT JJ NN IN JJ NN , TO WDT NN IN DT NNP MD VB VBN , VBZ TO VB DT NN IN DT NN .
6585	There were two general reasons for the mistaken monetary policy of the past 30 years :	EX VBD CD JJ NNS IN DT VBN JJ NN IN DT JJ CD NNS :

6589	The common proposals for reforming the Fed would only make the situation worse , if they had any effect at all .	DT JJ NNS IN VBG DT NNP MD RB VB DT NN JJR , IN PRP VBD DT NN IN DT .
6590	Putting the Secretary of the Treasury on the Board of Governors , one of the leading proposals today , is an example .	VBG DT NNP IN DT NNP IN DT NNP IN NNP , CD IN DT VBG NNS NN , VBZ DT NN .
6591	The secretary is the world 's biggest borrower of money .	DT NN VBZ DT NN POS JJS NN IN NN .
6592	He has a built-in , constant longing for lower interest rates .	PRP VBZ DT NN , JJ NN IN JJR NN NNS .

RB , PRP VBZ DT JJ NN IN DT JJ NN , WP RB VBZ JJ NN TO DT NN DT NN MD VB IN DT JJ NN , CC JJR TO PRP$ JJ NN .
6594	These days , the secretary suffers the further disqualification that he is a member of a club of seven finance ministers who meet occasionally to decide what exchange rates should be , which is a diversion from the real business of the Federal Reserve to stabilize the price level .	DT NNS , DT NN VBZ DT JJ NN IN PRP VBZ DT NN IN DT NN IN CD NN NNS WP VBP RB TO VB WP NN NNS MD VB , WDT VBZ DT NN IN DT JJ NN IN DT NNP NNP TO VB DT NN NN .
6595	How should a reasonable member of the Federal Reserve Board interpret a congressional decision to put the secretary on the board ?	WRB MD DT JJ NN IN DT NNP NNP NNP VB DT JJ NN TO VB DT NN IN DT NN .
6596	Could he plausibly interpret it as encouragement for the Fed to give primary emphasis to stabilizing the price level ?	MD PRP RB VB PRP IN NN IN DT NNP TO VB JJ NN TO VBG DT NN NN .

CC MD PRP VB PRP IN NN TO VB JJR NN TO DT JJ NNS IN DT NN VBZ : JJ NN NNS , JJ JJ NN , CC NN IN NN NNS IN RB VBD NNS .
6598	The answer seems perfectly clear .	DT NN VBZ RB JJ .

6600	By their constant readiness to advise all and sundry about federal budgetary matters the chairmen have encouraged the belief that fiscal policy and monetary policy are ingredients of a common stew , in which case it is natural that the Fed and the Treasury , and probably also the Congress , should be jointly engaged in stirring the pot .

6602	The Fed 's problem is not that it is too independent , or too unpolitical .	DT NNP POS NN VBZ RB IN PRP VBZ RB JJ , CC RB JJ .

7389	The main reason : salmonella .	DT JJ NN : NN .
